# Initial targets for the website

Published on 2025-08-31

## Table of contents

## Targets

Just about any knowledge I have acquired over the years that may sound interesting to you, I will try my best to share. I am far from the best person when it comes to journaling and blogging, but this might be the opportunity to change.

### To give

#### Tech tips

These can include software that I normally use, GitHub repositories (currently Discord themes and Linux dotfiles) as well as any troubleshooting for problems that I have come across.

#### Cooking tips

Something I want to focus on the most. Cooking has been and still remains an integral part of my daily life. Here I will likely post my cooking framework, including guides on ingredient choice, cooking methods etc.

#### Photography

This is where I will likely share my darktable LUTs for those interested in color grading, along with guides on mobile photography. Unsplash API could also be used to display random images from my Unsplash collections. 


## To learn

#### Language

As I am currently studying in Germany, I want to use this website as a chance to learn the German language. The website, along with all posts will be written in both English and German. Note here that the English version will be published first, followed by the German version some time later.

#### Making a website

Well, without a website nothing would be shared, right? So I would also like to brush up on some basic skills with these frameworks: Astro, UnoCSS (more along the way). The website source will be available over GitHub.

#### Writing skills

I am terrible at writing as an engineering student, so don't expect to read Shakespare level literature.
