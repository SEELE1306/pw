## Targets

Just about any knowledge I have acquired over the years that may sound interesting to you, I will try my best to share. I am far from the best person when it comes to journaling and blogging, but this might be the opportunity to change.

## To give

### Tech tips

These can include software that I normally use, GitHub repositories (currently Discord themes and Linux dotfiles) as well as any troubleshooting for problems that I have come across.

### Cooking tips

Something I want to focus on the most. Cooking has been and still remains an integral part of my daily life. Here I will likely post my cooking framework, including guides on ingredient choice, cooking methods etc.

### Photography

This is where I will likely share my darktable LUTs for those interested in color grading, along with guides on mobile photography. Unsplash API could also be used to display random images from my Unsplash collections.
